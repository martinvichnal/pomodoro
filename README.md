## Usage

The site has two main sections: Pomodoro and Todo list. Let's start with the pomodoro section!

### Pomodoro
The pomodoro section can be used like this:
- 1.: This is the timer which is displaying how much time left on your focuse session
- 2.: This is the control center. You can start the timer, stop or reset it. The Start button is only available if the countdown is not counting down. If the countdown is started the START button dissapears and a red STOP button appears insted.
- 3.: These are the quick sets. You can quickly set your desire session windows.
- 4.: This is just a simple tracker which is counting how many minutes you have focused so far.

#### Cool features
If the countdown is running all the buttons exept the STOP button is dissabled. This is in case of a missclick or other cases :)

### Todo
The todo section can be used like this:
- 1.: This is the section where you can name your task. For example: _Making a new spaceship_.
- 2.: This is the ADD button. Press it to add the task to your task list.
- 3.: This is were you can see all your pending tasks.
- 4.: If a chosen task is completed: First Good job! Then press the "Complete" button to cross the task off your list
- 5.: These are the completed tasks.

### Dark mode
The site has a dark mode function which is by the way automatic so it is changeing like your OS changes thems but you can trigger the dark mode with a simple button press on the top right corner in the navbar.
